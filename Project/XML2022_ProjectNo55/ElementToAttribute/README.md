# b2b-xml-convert-elements-to-attributes

Consider a company A and company B both producing different XML doc’s about their products categorized in similar
categories and having similar product properties. Construct for these companies two different DTD’s describing XML
semantics for their products (one focused on pure element usage and the other – on attribute usage). Develop DOM
applications for XML transformations from A to B and vice versa while preserving the information semantics.
